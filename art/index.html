		<p>Everything on this page is art made by me. There is no real deep meaning behind any of it. Most of these were made in order to learn how to use certain hardware. To keep things simple I have listed these in reverse creation order. To see how my art has developed over time you should go to the bottom of this page and scroll up.</p>
		<p>I have an affinity for bright colours and polygons. Realism is too much effort when I can just make my art simple and say it is stylized. </p>
