		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
		Hi, I'm Emily Jules Warr. 
		I&#8217;m currently an undergraduate studying English Literature at Anglia Ruskin University. 
		In my spare time I write programs, prose and poetry; more so now prose and poetry than programs. 
		I am currently volunteering with a group of people to make a mod of Fallout 4 called Fallout: London. 
		An open-world role-playing game set in Greater London during Bethesda&#8217;s post-apocalyptic future of Fallout. 
		My current role is head writer for the mod. 
		I work on quests and factions with the other writers but also ensure that everyone's work fits together and that what we create is consistent with the world space created by Bethesda Softworks, Obsidian Entertainment, Black Isle Studios, and Interplay Entertainment.
